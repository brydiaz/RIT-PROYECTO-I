After being appointed the new coach of the 1966 Texas Miners, Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) decides to build a team based on talent rather than race. The conservative townsfolk balk at the new racially diverse lineup despite the fact that the team is winning all their games. When black players like Bobby Joe Hill (Derek Luke) and team captain Harry Flournoy (Mehcad Brooks) begin to dominate the court with flashy moves, the racial tension increases, jeopardizing the future of the team.
