As Hurricane Katrina raged around them, Scott and Kimberly Rivers Roberts took shelter with some neighbors in their attic in New Orleans' Ninth Ward. Kimberly, an aspiring rapper, brought her video camera and filmed herself, her husband and their friends before and during the devastating storm. This footage is at the heart of Tia Lessin and Carl Deal's documentary about the Hurricane Katrina tragedy, along with the filmmakers' own footage of Kimberly and Scott rebuilding their lives afterwards.
