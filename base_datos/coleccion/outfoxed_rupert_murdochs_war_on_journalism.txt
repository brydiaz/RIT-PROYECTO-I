Left-leaning documentary filmmaker Robert Greenwald sets his sights on right-wing billionaire Rupert Murdoch in this takedown of the Australian media mogul's flagship, Fox News Channel. In deconstructing the conservative network's oft-touted slogan, "Fair and Balanced," Greenwald assembles archival footage of Fox News personalities like Bill O'Reilly and Neil Cavuto, as well as interviews with former employees and previously unseen interoffice memos from channel boss Roger Ailes.
