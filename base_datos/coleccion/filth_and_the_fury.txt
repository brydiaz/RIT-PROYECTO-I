Assembled from unseen archive footage, rare offcuts and masses of hilarious junk-culture detail from the pre-punk '70s, this inspired collage is as much passionate social history as rockumentary. Intercutting a touching, never-before-seen Sid Vicious interview with contemporary quotes from the surviving Pistols -- wittily filmed, like renegade villains, in silhouette -- Temple exposes the band's human side as never before.
