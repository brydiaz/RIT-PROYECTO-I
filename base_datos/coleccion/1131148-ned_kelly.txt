In the face of various underhanded maneuvers by local authorities, 19th century Australian bush ranger Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) flees to the outback with his brother, Dan (Laurence Kinlan), and two other cohorts (Orlando Bloom, Philip Barantini). As the gang's reputation grows, they take on Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), while Kelly encounters a little romance in the form of Julia Cook (Naomi Watts). It all comes to a violent head in the town of Glenrowan.
