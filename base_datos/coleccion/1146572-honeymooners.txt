Ralph Kramden (Cedric the Entertainer) drives a bus in New York City but dreams of something more. Unfortunately, none of Ralph's business ideas -- which often incorporate his best friend, Ed (Mike Epps) -- have panned out. Knowing their husbands will never get them out of the city, Ralph's wife, Alice (Gabrielle Union), and Ed's wife, Trixie (Regina Hall), pool their savings to purchase a house in the suburbs. But once the men find out about the secret stash, they might just blow it all.
