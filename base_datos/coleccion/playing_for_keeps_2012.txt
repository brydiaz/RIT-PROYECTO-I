Long past his soccer-playing heyday, George Dryer (Gerard Butler) is struggling financially and failing in his attempt to reconcile with his ex-wife, Stacie (Jessica Biel), and young son, Lewis (Noah Lomax). When Lewis' soccer team has an opening for a coach, George steps up. Not only is George a big hit with the children, but he also attracts lots of attention from some of the players' single and unhappily married mothers (Uma Thurman, Catherine Zeta-Jones).
