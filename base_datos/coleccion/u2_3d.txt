This concert film and its groundbreaking camerawork provide viewers with an immersive and unprecedented 3-D experience of the legendary Irish rockers' acclaimed "Vertigo" tour. U2 -- Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. -- perform thrilling renditions of latter-day hits like "Beautiful Day" and classic songs from their rich back catalog, including "Sunday Bloody Sunday," "Pride," "With or Without You" and "Where the Streets Have No Name."
