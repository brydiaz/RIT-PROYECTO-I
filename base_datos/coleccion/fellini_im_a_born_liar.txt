This in-depth documentary focuses on revered Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini. In addition to presenting clips from many of Fellini's acclaimed movies, the film features extensive interview footage with the lively and eccentric director, including revelatory conversations recorded in the years before he died. The production also includes interviews with actors who worked with the infamously moody auteur, most notably Roberto Benigni and Donald Sutherland.
