"Go Tigers!" is a rare behind-the-scenes chronicling of a remarkable season for the Massillon Tiger's high school football team, played out in a small town that draws its identity from football. During the course of the season, three young stars emerge who are forced to carry the burden of the town and their teammates as they confront their uncertain future. The film was shot on location in Ohio on High Definition video.
