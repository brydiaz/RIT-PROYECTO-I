In 1857 Capt. Alexander Fancher leads a wagon train of settlers across Utah to California. The Mormons eye the pioneers with suspicion when they stop in Mountain Meadows and demand that Fancher and his followers leave. Bishop Jacob Samuelson (Jon Voight) allows the travelers to stay for two weeks, and sends his son Jonathan (Trent Ford) to spy on them. What Jonathan does not know is that his father has dire plans for the innocent travelers, including the woman (Tamara Hope) Jonathan loves.
