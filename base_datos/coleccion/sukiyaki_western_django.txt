Ever since the Genpei War a few centuries before, two clans have been fighting over a hidden treasure. The white-clothed Genji, led by Yoshitsune (Yusuke Iseya), refuse to allow the opposing clan, the Kiyomori warriors -- who wear red and are led by Kiyomori (Koichi Sato) -- to keep all the wealth for themselves. When a stranger comes to town, he says he'll join whichever clan offers him more money. But the stranger has a hidden agenda: He is out to seek revenge on behalf of a prostitute.
