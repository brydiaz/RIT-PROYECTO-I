Ever since his wife (Stephanie Bishop) left him, Eric Bishop's (Steve Evets) life has fallen apart. His two teen sons (Gerard Kearns, Stefan Gumbs) have little regard for him, his job at the post office is increasingly unfulfilling and he ends up in the hospital after a car crash. One night, he smokes marijuana and has a vision of his favorite Manchester United soccer player: Eric Cantona. With the help of his idol and his daughter (Lucy-Jo Hudson), Eric tries to get his life straightened out.
