Filmmaker Deborah Scranton provides three U.S. soldiers with cameras so they can document their experiences during Operation Iraqi Freedom. The soldiers, Sgt. Steve Pink, Sgt. Zack Bazzi and Spc. Mike Moriarty, are all different ages and come from different backgrounds, but all three demonstrate unwavering loyalty to their comrades-in-arms while voicing concerns about America's reasons for its presence in Iraq.
