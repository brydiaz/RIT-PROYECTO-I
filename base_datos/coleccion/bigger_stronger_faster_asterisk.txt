This documentary presents the pervasive use of steroids in sports as an indication of the American obsession with winning at all costs. The Bell brothers have been sucked into the world of performance-enhancing drugs, thinking this is their ticket to realizing the American dream. Interviews with politicians, doctors, bodybuilders and coaches raise the question: Do the ends really justify the means? Because in the mad dash to win, an entire culture may be poised to lose.
