In 1933 a boy discovers an ancient Native American in a sideshow carnival tent. The Indian is Tonto (Johnny Depp), the old companion of John Reid (Armie Hammer), a lawman more famously known as the Lone Ranger. With this opportunity to set the record straight about his and Reid's adventures, Tonto recalls the day in 1869 when he first encountered the man who would be his trusted friend and tells of their teamwork bringing down Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and other Old West outlaws.
