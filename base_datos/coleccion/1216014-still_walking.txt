Twelve years after their beloved eldest son, Junpei, drowned while saving a stranger's life, Kyohei (Yoshio Harada) and Toshiko (Kirin Kiki) welcome their surviving children home for a family reunion. Younger son Ryota (Hiroshi Abe) still feels that his parents resent that he isn't the one who died; his new wife, Yukari (Yui Natsukawa), is awkwardly meeting the rest of the family for the first time. Daughter Chinami (You) strains to fill the uncomfortable pauses with forced cheer.
