Texas, 1875. In a land without justice, where chaos reigns, one legendary man, Leander McNelly (Dylan McDermott), is chosen to lead a group of unlikely heroes. These young men, out-manned and out-gunned, must battle an army of renegade outlaws led by the ruthless John King Fisher (Alfred Molina). Sworn to protect the innocent and the women they love (Rachael Leigh Cook), (Leonor Varela), the Rangers risk their lives to put the wrong things right in their beloved homeland.
