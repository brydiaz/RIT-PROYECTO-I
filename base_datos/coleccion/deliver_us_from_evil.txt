Filmmaker Amy Berg documents the case of convicted pedophile Oliver Grady who, as a priest in northern California, molested the children of his parishioners, apparently with the knowledge of his superiors in the diocese. Berg tracks down O'Grady in Ireland, where he lives free under church protection, and allows him to give his own account of his crimes.
