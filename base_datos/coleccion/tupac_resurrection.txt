Using interviews, photographs and home movies, this documentary presents the life of rapper Tupac Shakur. His mother, Afeni, is a Black Panther who spends part of her pregnancy in jail. Growing up in a politicized atmosphere, Shakur attends a performing arts high school in Baltimore, where he begins rapping. Success comes early, as do a series of legal problems, with arrests and accusations of violence against women leading up to his meteoric rise to fame and still-unsolved 1996 murder.
