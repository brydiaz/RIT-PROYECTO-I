Through extensive use of archival clips, documentarian Don Hahn explores how Walt Disney Animation Studios broke out of their mid-1980s box-office slump. The film focuses on the group of young, ambitious animators and filmmakers, such as Tim Burton and "Toy Story" director John Lasseter, who struggled against outside competition and old-guard studio executives within the company to reclaim Disney's legacy as a producer of world-class animated entertainment.
