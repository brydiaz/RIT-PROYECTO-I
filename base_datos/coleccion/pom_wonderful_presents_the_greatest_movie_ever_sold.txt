Fascinated by the ubiquity of advertising, documentarian Morgan Spurlock decides to make a film solely financed by product placement. Though many of the companies he contacts decline to participate, Spurlock gains support from businesses such as JetBlue Airways and Ban deodorant. While pitching his ideas, Spurlock visits Sao Paulo, where commercial outdoor displays have been banned, and a Florida school district forced to allow in-school advertising to continue operating.
