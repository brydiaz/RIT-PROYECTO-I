A young Brazilian hijacks a bus in Rio de Janeiro to rob its passengers. When he holds the entire bus hostage, the press broadcasts it live. This documentary chronicles the incompetent response by police officers to the public event inspired nationwide protest. Included are details about the captor's harsh childhood after witnessing his mother's murder. His homelessness provides but one example of the tragic social and political indifference for urban poverty in modern Brazil.
