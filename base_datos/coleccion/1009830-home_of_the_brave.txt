Paralyzed African-American veteran Peter Moss (James Edwards) is undergoing psychoanalysis after suffering a nervous breakdown. As Moss recounts his trauma to an army psychiatrist (Jeff Corey), he reveals countless examples of the everyday racism he experienced as a civilian. Moss also discusses an intense mission he went on during World War II. Although he is psychically damaged, his doctor believes Moss can walk again if he can figure out a way to let go of his emotional wounds.
