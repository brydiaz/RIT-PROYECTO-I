Upon hearing of the engagement of her housekeeper, Roohi (Taraneh Alidoosti), housewife Mozhde (Hedye Tehrani) sends the betrothed to enjoy free services at a local salon -- provided that she eavesdrop to verify suspicions that her wealthy husband, Morteza (Hamid Farokhnezhad), is having an affair. But when -- in a misguided attempt to mend the Samieis' impossibly broken marriage -- Roohi ignores Mozhde's instructions, her naive meddling may throw the couple even deeper into turmoil.
