In this animated musical, Spot (Nathan Lane) is a snarky blue-furred dog whose greatest desire is to be transformed into a human, and who already dons a human costume so he can pose as a student at a local school. Opportunity strikes when he sees a television commercial in which Doctor Krank (Kelsey Grammer) claims to be able to turn animals into humans. However, when the experiment goes wrong, Spot must enlist the help of his owner, Leonard Helperman.
