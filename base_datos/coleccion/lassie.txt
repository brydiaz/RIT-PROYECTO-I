Young Joe Carraclough (Jonathan Mason) and his family (Samantha Morton, John Lynch) love their faithful collie, Lassie. However, when Joe's father loses his job in the mine, he must sell the dog to the Duke of Rudling (Peter O'Toole), who covets the collie for his granddaughter (Hester Odgers). After the duke moves to northern Scotland to avoid the threat of World War II, Lassie escapes and undertakes a 500-mile journey to reunite with her family.
