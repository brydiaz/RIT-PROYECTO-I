Rucker Park in New York City's Harlem has been host to many legends, such as Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Now, the top high-school basketball players in America will assemble on the same court to compete in the first annual "Elite 24" all-star game, which is seen as a good measure of a player's NBA potential. This documentary trails eight of the teens as -- preparing to become champions -- they demonstrate the required dedication that accompanies a swift rise to greatness.
