Leni Dali (Marián Aguilera), a successful television reporter, decides the time is finally right to bring the new love in her life, Rafi (Guillermo Toledo), to meet her rather eccentric Jewish family. As could be expected, Rafi harbors some anxiety about the meeting, and his concern is not unfounded. Each family member turns out to have a different personality flaw that makes feeling at home hard to do -- especially when they discover Rafi is Palestinian.
