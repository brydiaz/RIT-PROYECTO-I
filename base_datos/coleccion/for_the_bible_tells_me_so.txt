Delving into values of the religious right and the accompanying homophobia, "For the Bible Tells Me So" focuses on how conservative Christians' interpretation of the Bible is commonly used as a way to deny homosexuals equal rights. Following five families with an openly gay son or daughter, director Daniel G. Karslake offers a firsthand look at how those in the Christian community with an out child are affected by the homophobic fervor. Karslake also interviews a number of religious leaders.
