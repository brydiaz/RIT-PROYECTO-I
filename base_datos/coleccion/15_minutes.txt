At the center of "15 Minutes" is a New York City double murder that must be solved. But the fast-paced story isn't so much about figuring out the truth of the murder, as following who controls that truth. This is the thriller as seen through an eye-popping new lens -- that of the media's hunt for shocking imagery, no matter the cost. In "15 Minutes," as the cops chase the murderers, the media chases the cops, and the whole thing fuels an escalating firestorm.
