In this musical, college student Justin (Justin Guarini) arrives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for spring break with his friends Brandon (Greg Siff) and Eddie (Brian Dietzen), and quickly crosses paths with waitress Kelly (Kelly Clarkson). Although Justin falls for Kelly almost instantly, Kelly's jealous friend, Alexa (Katherine Bailess), tries her best to keep the two apart. With the help of several song-and-dance numbers, however, Justin and Kelly eventually connect and make sweet music together.
