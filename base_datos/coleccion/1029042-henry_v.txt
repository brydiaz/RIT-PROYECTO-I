In this gritty screen adaptation of Shakespeare's play about the heroic and ruthless king, Henry V of England (Kenneth Branagh) determines to lay claim to the kingdom of France. Henry's self-doubt and the diminished morale of his army stand in the way of a victory that would unite the two countries and provide Henry with a queen (Emma Thompson). However, his sheer determination and his impassioned speeches ready his men for the bloodiest of battles -- Agincourt.
