During the final leg of Major League Baseball's 2001 season, Giants batter Barry Bonds scores a historic 73rd home run at San Francisco's Pac Bell Park. Victorious in the ensuing scuffle for control of the record-breaking ball is spectator Patrick Hayashi -- a notion disputed by nearby Alex Popov, who claims Hayashi wrestled the ball from him. Director Michael Wranovics examines the resulting court battle, the media circus following the event and the obsessed fans behind the controversy.
