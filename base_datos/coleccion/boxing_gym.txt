The veteran award-winning documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman turns his lens on the world of boxing, specifically on a gym in Austin, Texas. Unobtrusively recording the simple comings and goings at the facility, Wiseman documents daily life at the gym, its many patrons, their routines and its owner, Richard Lord. The film forgoes techniques common to modern documentaries -- talking-head interviews, reenactments, etc. -- in favor of a low-key approach.
