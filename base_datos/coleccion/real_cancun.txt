The annual debauchery of college students during spring break is examined in this documentary, which focuses on 16 young Americans as they travel to Cancun, Mexico, where they indulge in voluminous consumption of sex and booze. Over the course of 11 days, the students -- including such archetypes as a ladies' man, a party girl and a virgin -- are followed by cameras as they drink profusely and attempt to hook up with as many members of the opposite sex as circumstances allow.
