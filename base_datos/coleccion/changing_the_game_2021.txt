This intimate story takes us into the lives of three high school athletes from across the US -- all at different stages of their athletic seasons, each sharing their lives as transgender teens. Our main character, Mack Beggs, made headlines last year when he became the Texas State Champion in girls wrestling -- as a boy. Fighting Texas State policy and drawing international media coverage, he was heralded as a hero by some while receiving hate and threats from others. The tumultuous press surrounding his success continues to pull Mack in multiple directions as he and his family navigate the media and this year's State wrestling tournament, all while trying to graduate high school. Each story is led by the brave and individual voices of these students, allowing extremely personal and vulnerable access into their journeys. These courageous kids offer us the opportunity to see the world through their eyes -- and share their struggles and successes along the way.
