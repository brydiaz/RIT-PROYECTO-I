Gertrude Berg rose to prominence in the 1930s as the star of "The Goldbergs," a pioneering radio program and, later, a TV sitcom, which she also created, wrote and produced. Director Aviva Kempner tells the story of this important, overlooked figure in entertainment history, explaining her background -- she arrived in the U.S. as an inexperienced Jewish immigrant -- and interviewing notable figures such as writer/producer Norman Lear and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg.
