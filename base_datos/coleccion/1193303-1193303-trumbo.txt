Like the protagonist of his classic film "Spartacus," leftist screenwriter Dalton Trumbo has a rebellious streak. During the McCarthy era, Trumbo refuses to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee and is sentenced to 11 months in prison. Blacklisted in Hollywood, Trumbo resorts to writing scripts under a pseudonym. The film uses archival footage, interviews and actors reading Trumbo's brilliant letters and scripts to construct a portrait of an uncompromising artist.
