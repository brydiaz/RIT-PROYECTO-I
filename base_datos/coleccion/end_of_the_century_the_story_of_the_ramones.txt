Joey, Johnny and Dee Dee -- better known as The Ramones -- changed the course of rock history with their rebellious punk ethos and minimalist approach to songwriting, and in the process became counterculture icons. "End of the Century" follows the Queens kids from their earliest underground gigs in the 1970s to their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, featuring rare archive concert footage and candid interviews with the band members.
