Director Havana Marking dives into the booming, but still young and growing, world of pop culture in Afghanistan. Newly liberated after more than 30 years of stifling Taliban rule, the country is taken with a fervor for expression. This documentary follows four contestants, including two women, as they audition, sing and compete in a countrywide "American Idol"-type competition called "Pop Idol." Marking uncovers a wonderfully vibrant community, which is also surprisingly accepting.
