Before beginning a new job, Gaspard (Melvil Poupaud) goes to a beach town to relax for a few weeks. He waits for Lena (Aurelia Nolin), a girl he has been casually dating for some time. When she does not arrive, he strikes up a friendship with waitress Margot (Amanda Langlet). Through her, Gaspard also meets Solene (Gwenaëlle Simon), a free spirit open to a physical relationship if he agrees to be faithful. As Gaspard spends time with each, he finds his feelings even further conflicted.
